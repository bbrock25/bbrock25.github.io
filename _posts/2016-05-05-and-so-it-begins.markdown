I'm going to keep this short in the interest in getting some content out
there. You know, ship often and such...

My name is Bill Brock and I'm a software developer, husband, entrepreneur,
academic, exercise fanatic, and a huge fan of my hometown of [Chattanooga
TN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee).  Over the last 7-10
years I've had the privelidge of working and serving in a variety of roles which
have all had very large impacts on the way I view the world today. Here are some
of the high points:

* [UT Chattanooga - 2011 MS in Computational Engineering](https://www.utc.edu/college-engineering-computer-science/research-centers/simcenter/)
* SimCenter Enterprises  - Computational Engineering and Project Management
* [Mozilla Ignite](https://mozillaignite.org/) - award recipient for developing a
  live stream using the microsoft kinect and other javascript things
* [1 Million Cups](http://www.1millioncups.com/) - kicked off the Chattanooga
  chapter
* Software Engineer at [Lamp Post Group](http://lamppostgroup.com/)
* Owner operator of a failed software contracting group
* Senior Softare Enginneer at [Spartan Systems](http://joinspartan.com/)

I feel that my experience really crosses a lot of areas in our industry, filling
most roles in a software development shop at one time or another. Right now my
focus is on writing quality software, under reasonable time constraints.
However, my interests have always been how that applies to small / emerging
businesses, as evident by my track record. One thing I do know is that I'm not a
huge fan of sales. I'll save those experiences for anther post.

The point of this blog is to document my learnings from here on in a public
capacity. There is truly a great amount of knowledge out there on the internet,
and I would like to contribute back to the community from which I have been able
to obtain a career. I hope that you enjoy the ramblings and documentation of
my journey.
